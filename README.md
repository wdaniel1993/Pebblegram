# Pebblegram

Pebblegram brings Telegram to Pebble watches with a PebbleKit JS Telegram client. The watch app gives you a fast inbox, readable message threads, inline photo previews, canned replies, and dictation replies without a separate companion service.

## Quick Start

1. Install [release/Pebblegram.pbw](release/Pebblegram.pbw) with the Pebble/Rebble mobile app.
2. Open Pebblegram settings in the Pebble mobile app.
3. Enter your Telegram API ID, API hash, and phone number.
4. Save once to request a Telegram login code.
5. Reopen settings, enter the login code, and save again.
6. If Telegram asks for two-step verification, reopen settings, enter your Telegram cloud password, and save again.

Create Telegram API credentials at [my.telegram.org/apps](https://my.telegram.org/apps).

## Development

Install the Pebble SDK/tooling, then build:

```sh
pebble build
```

Build the bundled Telegram client:

```sh
npm install
npm run build:pgjs-gramjs
```

For local testing with embedded API credentials, keep them in an ignored environment file such as `.env.pgjs.local`, then source it before building the bundle. Do not commit personal API credentials, Telegram sessions, or generated PBWs that contain credentials.

## Project Structure

- `src/c/Pebblegram.c`: watch UI, AppMessage handling, scrolling, image decoding, actions, dictation
- `src/pkjs/index.js`: PebbleKit JS runtime and watch communication
- `src/pkjs/config.html`: Pebble settings page
- `src/pkjs/pgjs/`: Telegram client, auth, settings storage, and image processing
- `resources/images/menu_icon.png`: launcher/app-list icon bundled into the PBW
- `store/screenshots/`: store listing screenshots
- `release/`: packaged PBW

## Security Notes

- Do not commit `.env`, `.env.*`, Telegram session files, generated personal PBWs, ngrok configs, or account tokens.
- Public release builds must not embed a personal Telegram API ID or API hash.
- Telegram API ID/hash are required by Telegram's MTProto API. The public PBW does not embed a personal API ID/hash.

## Status

Pebblegram 2.0 is the first direct Telegram build. The core flows work, but this is still community software for an unsupported watch platform.
